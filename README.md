# AR-Art-Unity-Learn

Is it art, I don't know ðŸ˜€.  I am working on making it more interesting.

This project is based on a tutorial exercise on Unity Learn.

The basic code is working using Unity 2022
- it has been tested on iOS but there is bug in the Xcode project creation; you need to add the icon asset to the project otherwise there is a fatal build error; at this time Unity 2022 is not a LTS release. 
  
- the scene is using the detection of marker to position a 3D mesh.

- the 3d mesh assets are copyright David O'Reilly, CC license
